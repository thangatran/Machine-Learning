CS445 - Homework 5

This is the implementation of K-means clustering based on the optdigit data from homework 1
The program is written in Python.
In order to run the program, it requires numpy and scipy packages to be installed. 
For Ubuntu, to install numpy and scipy packages, input the command
	sudo apt-get install python-numpy
        sudo apt-get install python-scipy
To run the program, input the command:
	python hw5.py
This will print the result of sum-squared error, average entropy, the accuracy on the test data, and the confusion matrix on the terminal
The visualizations of k centroids are stored as jpg image files in the current directory named digitofClusterk.jpg where k is the cluster number of k clusters
