CS445 - Homework 2

For the implementation of Perceptron, I use python as my implementing language.
So basically, the program will read the files named optdigits.data as training data and optdigits.test as test data.
The program will train the training data so that the accuracy will be 100% and then calculate the accuracy of the test data.
To run the program, input the command:
	python perceptron.py
It will generate a file called outputResult which contains the number of epoches, the accuracy on test and training data, the confusion matrix of each task corresponding a given learning rate.
